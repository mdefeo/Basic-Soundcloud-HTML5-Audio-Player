===================================

This is some stripped down code that will allow you to access tracks from a Soundcloud playlist and play them in an HTML5 audio player. 

Dependencies
===================================

1. jQuery (although you can modify the code to use vanilla JavaScript)
2. Soundcloud Developer App: http://soundcloud.com/you/apps
3. Client ID: You can get this when you register your app on Soundcloud
4. User ID: You should be able to use this to get your user id: https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#resolve

Notes
===================================

1. As the description states, this is a pretty basic block of code. Feel free to expand upon it and make it your own.
2. Bits of this code were cobbled together from other open source resources found online.
3. Best of luck and I look forward to seeing awesome things people create!
